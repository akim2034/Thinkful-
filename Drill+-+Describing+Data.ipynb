    "I would say around 18.5% of adults were fans of the Brady Bunch. The SciPhi Fanatic subscribers are a niche group so their ratings wouldn't be an accurate portrayal of the general adult population's sentiments. Hence, their 5% result is an outlier. However, with broader groups like the 3 other subscription, we probably get a more reflective result of the population. Hence, the median, which is not heavily influenced by outliers is the better measure of central tendency here. "
